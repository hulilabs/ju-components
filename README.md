# Web Components
This library can be used as a standalone library or as a separate dependencies library, in which case we will need to add the following entry to the require config file:


require.config({
    paths: {
        'ju-shared' : 'lib/vendor/components',
        'ju-components' : 'lib/vendor/components',
        'ju-mvc' : 'lib/vendor/components'
    }
});
